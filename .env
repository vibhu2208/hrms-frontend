# ========================================
# HRMS Frontend - Environment Configuration
# ========================================
# Centralized config automatically detects environment
# No manual switching needed between dev and production!

# Production API URL (automatically used in production builds)
VITE_API_URL=https://hrms-backend-xbz8.onrender.com

# Note: During development (npm run dev):
# - API requests use '/api' (proxied via vite.config.js to localhost:5000)
# - No need to change this file for local development
# - See src/config/api.config.js for automatic environment detection
