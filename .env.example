# API Configuration
# Production backend URL
VITE_API_URL=https://hrms-backend-xbz8.onrender.com

# Development Setup:
# - During development (npm run dev), API requests are proxied to avoid CORS issues
# - The proxy configuration in vite.config.js forwards /api requests to the backend
# - No CORS configuration needed for development

# For Vercel deployment:
# 1. Set VITE_API_URL in your Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Use the production URL: https://hrms-backend-xbz8.onrender.com
